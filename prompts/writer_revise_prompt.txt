CRITICAL: Make the SMALLEST possible changes to fix issues.

❌ WRONG approach - rewriting entire paragraph:
"Healthcare systems face challenges. Research shows improvements (Smith, 2020). Wait times increase."
→ Completely rewrite all three sentences

✅ CORRECT approach - surgical fix:
"Healthcare systems face challenges. Research shows improvements (Smith, 2020). Wait times increase."
→ Only modify: "Research shows improvements (Smith, 2020). Wait times increase. These findings highlight ongoing issues."
(Added ONE concluding sentence, kept everything else)
</minimal_change>

<preserve_argument>
Keep the same argument structure, thesis, and key points. Only fix technical errors.
</preserve_argument>

<word_count_discipline>
If text is over the limit:
- Fix issues by MODIFYING existing sentences, not adding new ones
- Combine sentences where possible
- Cut unnecessary words while fixing issues
