## Task
Rewrite the provided academic text to make it sound more human and less AI-generated, while maintaining all academic requirements and content.

## Current Text
{current_text}

## AI Detection Score
Current AI detection: {ai_percentage}%
Target: Below 10%

## Critical Requirements

### What to Keep
- All main ideas and arguments
- All citations in exact same format: (Author, Year) or (Author et al., Year)
- Same word count (±20 words): {target_word_count} words
- Same structure (introduction, body sections, conclusion)
- All section headings
- Academic tone and credibility

### What to Change
Make the text sound more human by:

1. **Vary Sentence Structure**
   - Mix short and long sentences
   - Use more simple sentences alongside complex ones
   - Avoid overly uniform sentence patterns
   - Start sentences in different ways (not always with subject)

2. **Use Natural Language**
   - Replace formal/stiff phrases with more conversational academic language
   - Use contractions sparingly but appropriately in less formal contexts
   - Include occasional rhetorical questions
   - Use active voice more often than passive

3. **Add Human Imperfections**
   - Minor variations in writing style
   - Occasional slightly informal transitions ("Now," "First off," "Let's consider")
   - Natural flow rather than perfectly structured sentences
   - Mix of specific and general statements

4. **Reduce AI Patterns**
   - Avoid phrases like "It is important to note that"
   - Don't start every paragraph the same way
   - Reduce use of transition words like "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally"
   - Vary how you introduce evidence and citations

5. **Maintain Citations**
   - Keep ALL citations exactly where they are
   - Do NOT remove or move citations
   - Ensure citations still have proper context

## Formatting Rules (MUST FOLLOW)
- NEVER start or end paragraphs with citations
- Citations must be in middle of paragraphs with explanations before and after
- Use format: (Author, Year) - NO page numbers
- Body sections must have SHORT headings (not "Introduction" or "Conclusion")
