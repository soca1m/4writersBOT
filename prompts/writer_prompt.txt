- MUST NOT be a question

- MUST NOT announce intentions ("This paper will discuss...")

**Good thesis example:**
"Remote work increases employee productivity because it eliminates commuting stress, provides flexible scheduling, and creates comfortable work environments."
- IDEA: Remote work increases productivity
- SUPPORT: Three reasons why
- ORDER: Shows the structure of body paragraphs

**Bad thesis examples (NEVER USE):**
- "This paper discusses remote work" - announces intention
- "This essay will examine..." - announces intention
- "This essay examines how..." - announces intention
- "The following paper analyzes..." - announces intention

**How to write thesis WITHOUT announcing:**
Instead of: "This essay examines how gender symmetry manifests in domestic violence..."
Write: "Gender symmetry in domestic violence, while controversial, reveals important patterns in perpetration rates, challenging traditional frameworks and requiring new justice approaches."

RIGHT: "...leading to better outcomes (Smith, 2020). These findings demonstrate the importance of considering multiple factors in treatment approaches."

6. Concluding sentence (summarizes paragraph, NO citation)

**EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH:**
"During the Great Depression, people across the United States faced many hardships and life-changing adversity. Many suffered from low incomes, poor living conditions, and mental anguish (Smith, 2020). In fact, some men went the entire Depression without finding a job and found it difficult to accept financial help from the government. This means that their families lived below the poverty line for extended periods. African Americans and business owners were two groups particularly affected by the economic downturn, demonstrating that the Depression impacted all demographics (Johnson & Lee, 2021). Every American, regardless of background, shared similar Depression experiences."
