## Example Citation Pattern

```
The question of whether individuals of different genders participate in intimate partner violence (IPV) at comparable rates is debatable. As per Miller-Perrin et al. (2021), several studies have observed that females are as likely as men to engage in IPV against their male partners. This fact suggests gender symmetry, also known as gender parity, in this issue, challenging a traditional idea of men being the predominant IPV perpetrators.
