- Phrases at sentence start: "And...", "But...", "Or..."

**VIOLATION:** If essay contains informal language or announcement phrases

---

**8. CITATION ACCURACY AND VALIDITY**

**CRITICAL CHECK:** Verify that cited information actually matches source abstracts.

For EACH sentence with a citation:
1. Identify the claim/information in the sentence
2. Find the corresponding source abstract in {sources_info}
3. Verify the abstract supports the claim

**What counts as ACCURATE citation:**
✓ Claim is directly stated in the abstract
✓ Claim is a reasonable interpretation of abstract data
✓ Claim discusses the same topic/concept as the abstract

**What counts as INACCURATE/FABRICATED:**
✗ Claim makes specific statements NOT mentioned in the abstract
✗ Claim attributes findings/data that don't appear in the abstract
✗ Claim discusses entirely different topic than the abstract
✗ Claim invents statistics, percentages, or specific results not in abstract

**Examples:**

ABSTRACT: "Single-payer systems in Canada achieved 95% coverage with 30% lower administrative costs compared to multi-payer systems."

✅ ACCURATE: "Research shows single-payer systems reduce administrative costs (Smith, 2020)."
✅ ACCURATE: "Administrative costs in single-payer systems are substantially lower (Smith, 2020)."
✗ INACCURATE: "Single-payer systems eliminate all healthcare disparities (Smith, 2020)." ← NOT in abstract
✗ INACCURATE: "Studies show 40% cost reduction in single-payer models (Smith, 2020)." ← Wrong number

**VIOLATION:** If ANY citation references information not supported by the source abstract

**Note:** This is a CRITICAL check. Fabricated citations are academic dishonesty.

</quality_rules>

<checking_instructions>

**Step 1: Assignment Completion (MOST IMPORTANT)**
- Read {main_question} carefully
- Identify ALL questions/requirements (count them if multiple bullet points)
- For EACH question, check:
  1. Is it addressed in the essay?
  2. Is the answer SUBSTANTIVE (not just 1 sentence)?
  3. Does it include explanation, reasoning, or examples?
  4. For "discuss" - is there detailed analysis?
  5. For "identify X barriers/strategies" - are X items listed and explained?
- If any question is unanswered, partially answered, or answered superficially (1 sentence only), report violation with:
  - rule: "ASSIGNMENT INCOMPLETE"
  - problem: "Question '[specific question]' is not answered" OR "Question '[specific question]' is answered superficially (only 1 sentence, needs detailed discussion)"
  - location: "Assignment requirements"

**Step 2: Introduction Check**
- Find section with "## Introduction" heading
- Look for announcement phrases ("In this paper", "This essay will", "I will discuss")
- Look for dictionary definitions
- Check if thesis is at the end

**Step 3: Thesis Check**
- Identify the thesis (last sentence of introduction section)
- Check if it follows ISO: Idea + Support + Order
- Check if it announces intentions or restates task

**Step 4: Citation Placement**
- For Introduction/Conclusion sections: Check for ANY citations → violation
- For body section paragraphs:
  - Check FIRST sentence for citation → violation
  - Check LAST sentence for citation → violation
  - Middle sentences should have citations (this is correct)

**Step 5: Body Paragraph Structure**
- Count sentences in each body paragraph
- Check if first sentence is a topic sentence (no citation)
- Check if last sentence is a conclusion (no citation)
- Check if paragraph discusses ONE idea

**Step 6: Conclusion Check**
- Verify "## Conclusion" section exists
- Check for citations → violation
- Check for new information not discussed in body

**Step 7: Academic Language**
- Scan for "I", "we", "you", "my", "our"
- Scan for "In this paper", "This essay will", "I will discuss"
- Scan for rhetorical questions

**Step 8: Citation Accuracy (CRITICAL CHECK)**
- Extract ALL sentences that contain citations (Author, Year)
- For EACH cited sentence:
  1. Identify what claim/information is being made
  2. Extract the citation (e.g., "Smith, 2020")
  3. Find the corresponding source in {sources_info}
  4. Read the source's abstract carefully
  5. Verify: Does the abstract support this claim?

- If claim is NOT supported by abstract → report violation:
  - rule: "CITATION INACCURATE"
  - problem: "Claim '[describe claim]' is not supported by source abstract"
  - citation_found: "(Author, Year)"
  - sentence: "The full sentence with the citation"

**Examples of violations to catch:**
- Essay says "reduces costs by 40% (Smith, 2020)" but abstract doesn't mention 40%
- Essay says "eliminates disparities (Jones, 2021)" but abstract doesn't discuss disparities
- Essay says "improves outcomes (Miller, 2022)" but abstract is about different topic

**CRITICAL:**
- Only report violations you ACTUALLY SEE
- If unsure, do NOT report
- Focus on serious issues that affect quality
- Citation accuracy is HIGHEST priority - fabricated claims are academic dishonesty

**Example 1: GOOD Essay**

Assignment: "Discuss 1 advantage and 1 disadvantage of single-payer medicine. What barriers exist to having universal health care in the United States? How might these barriers be overcome?"

```
## Introduction

Single-payer healthcare systems represent a fundamental shift from market-based insurance models. This approach offers both benefits and challenges for the United States. Single-payer medicine provides universal coverage and cost efficiency while raising concerns about implementation costs, yet political resistance and industry lobbying create substantial barriers that require comprehensive reform and public education to overcome.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Single-payer systems provide the critical advantage of eliminating financial barriers to healthcare access. Research demonstrates that countries with single-payer models achieve universal coverage while spending less per capita (Smith, 2020). When healthcare becomes a guaranteed right, patients receive necessary treatment without bankruptcy fears. This approach reduces administrative complexity and allows governments to negotiate lower drug prices through bulk purchasing power.

However, these systems present the disadvantage of potentially longer wait times for non-emergency procedures. Critics argue that government-run healthcare can reduce efficiency and innovation (Jones, 2021). The tension between access and delivery speed remains a central concern in policy debates.

## Barriers to Universal Healthcare

Political resistance represents the primary barrier to implementing universal healthcare in the United States. Conservative lawmakers argue that government involvement threatens market competition and individual choice. Industry lobbying from insurance companies and pharmaceutical corporations creates additional obstacles, as these entities invest millions in campaign contributions to protect their profit margins. Cultural beliefs about personal responsibility and limited government further complicate reform efforts.

## Overcoming the Barriers

These barriers require comprehensive strategies to overcome. Public education campaigns can shift perceptions by highlighting successful models in other developed nations. Grassroots movements and advocacy organizations can counter industry lobbying through sustained political pressure. Incremental reforms that expand existing programs like Medicare may provide a politically viable pathway toward universal coverage.

## Conclusion

Single-payer healthcare offers significant advantages through universal coverage and cost reduction, yet faces challenges from wait times and implementation barriers. Political resistance and industry opposition require sustained reform efforts and public engagement to overcome.

SOURCE 1: (Smith, 2020)
Title: Single-payer healthcare systems achieve universal coverage
Abstract: This study examines single-payer healthcare systems in 15 developed nations. Findings show these systems achieve near-universal coverage (95-99%) while maintaining lower per-capita spending compared to multi-payer systems. Administrative costs are reduced by 30-40% through unified billing and payment systems.

SOURCE 2: (Jones, 2021)
Title: Healthcare delivery efficiency in government-run systems
Abstract: Analysis of healthcare delivery in various models reveals trade-offs between access and wait times. Government-managed systems show longer wait times for elective procedures (average 4-6 weeks vs 1-2 weeks in private systems) while maintaining better emergency response times.
```

**Analysis:**
✅ Assignment completion: ALL 4 questions answered with substantive discussion:
   1. ✅ 1 advantage - universal coverage/cost reduction (full paragraph)
   2. ✅ 1 disadvantage - wait times (full paragraph)
   3. ✅ Barriers - political resistance, industry lobbying, cultural beliefs (dedicated section with multiple barriers explained)
   4. ✅ How to overcome - public education, grassroots movements, incremental reforms (dedicated section with multiple solutions)
✅ Citation accuracy:
   - "achieve universal coverage while spending less per capita (Smith, 2020)" ✓ Supported by abstract
   - "government-run healthcare can reduce efficiency (Jones, 2021)" ✓ Supported by abstract (wait times discussion)
✅ Introduction: No announcements, has thesis at end with ISO structure
✅ Thesis: "Single-payer medicine provides... yet... that require..." - clear Idea + Support + Order
✅ Citations: Only in middle sentences of body paragraphs
✅ Body paragraphs: Topic sentence first, citations in middle, conclusion last (5+ sentences each)
✅ Conclusion: No citations, summarizes main points
✅ Language: Academic, no "I/we/you"

**Result:** NO VIOLATIONS

## Body Paragraph

Single-payer healthcare systems offer multiple benefits. Research shows that single-payer systems eliminate all health disparities and achieve 100% coverage (Smith, 2020). Studies demonstrate that these systems reduce costs by 60% while improving all health outcomes (Jones, 2021). These findings support widespread adoption.

   - Smith abstract mentions "near-universal coverage (95-99%)" NOT 100%
   - Smith abstract does NOT mention health disparities at all
   - VIOLATION: Fabricated claims not supported by source

❌ CITATION INACCURATE: Sentence says "reduce costs by 60% while improving all health outcomes (Jones, 2021)"
   - Jones abstract discusses wait times and efficiency trade-offs
   - Jones abstract does NOT mention 60% cost reduction
   - Jones abstract does NOT discuss health outcomes improvement
   - VIOLATION: Completely fabricated statistics and claims

**Result:** CRITICAL VIOLATIONS - Both citations are inaccurate/fabricated
