<expansion_strategies>
<strategy_1>
Add more detailed explanations to existing paragraphs
<example>
BEFORE: "Healthcare costs are rising in the United States."
AFTER: "Healthcare costs are rising in the United States, creating significant financial burdens for both individuals and government programs. This upward trajectory has persisted for decades, outpacing wage growth and inflation."
</example>
</strategy_1>

<strategy_2>
Add more examples or elaborations
<example>
BEFORE: "Single-payer systems have advantages."
AFTER: "Single-payer systems have advantages, particularly in administrative efficiency. Countries like Canada and the United Kingdom demonstrate how centralized systems reduce paperwork, streamline billing processes, and eliminate redundant administrative layers."
</example>
</strategy_2>

<strategy_3>
Expand on key arguments with additional sentences that develop the logic
</strategy_3>

<strategy_4>
Add transitional sentences between paragraphs to improve flow
</strategy_4>

<strategy_5>

</strategy_5>
</expansion_strategies>

<critical_rules>
1. DO NOT add citations or references (Bot 3 handles citations separately)
2. DO NOT repeat the same ideas - add NEW content and insights
3. Maintain academic tone and formal writing style
4. Keep the same structure (intro, body sections, conclusion)
5. Ensure expanded content still answers the main question
6. DO NOT add a References section
7. Focus on depth rather than breadth - develop existing points more fully
</critical_rules>

<output_instruction>
Return the COMPLETE expanded text (not just the additions). The text should be substantially longer while maintaining coherence and academic quality.
