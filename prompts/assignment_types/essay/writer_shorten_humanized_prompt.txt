<shortening_strategy>
**How to shorten while preserving human style:**

1. **Remove redundant sentences** - Delete sentences that repeat the same point
2. **Combine similar ideas** - Merge sentences that say similar things
3. **Remove filler words** - Cut unnecessary phrases like "it is important to note that"
4. **Shorten wordy phrases** - Use concise alternatives
5. **Remove secondary examples** - Keep the strongest example, remove weaker ones

**DO NOT:**
- Change the natural flow or rhythm of sentences
- Make sentences overly formal or structured
- Remove transitions that make it sound human
- Change contractions if they exist (don't → do not)
- Remove casual phrases that make it sound human

**PRESERVE:**
- Natural sentence variety (short and long sentences mixed)
- Conversational transitions
- Human-like imperfections
- The author's voice and tone
- ALL citations exactly as they are
