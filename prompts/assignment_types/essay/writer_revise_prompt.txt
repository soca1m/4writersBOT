**STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS** (Follow this EXACTLY):

WHEN YOU SEE: "CITATION IN LAST SENTENCE: 'sentence text here (Author, Year).'"

STEP 1: Find that EXACT sentence in your text
STEP 2: Add ONE short concluding sentence (8-15 words) IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT
STEP 3: Leave everything else unchanged

EXAMPLE:
ERROR MESSAGE: "CITATION IN LAST SENTENCE: 'Concerns about taxation (Galvani et al., 2022) create skepticism.'"

FIND THIS IN TEXT:
"...Powerful stakeholder groups oppose reforms. Concerns about taxation (Galvani et al., 2022) create skepticism."

FIX IT LIKE THIS:
"...Powerful stakeholder groups oppose reforms. Concerns about taxation (Galvani et al., 2022) create skepticism. These barriers complicate implementation."
                                                                                                              ^^^ Added ONE sentence after the citation

WHEN YOU SEE: "CITATION IN FIRST SENTENCE: 'sentence text here (Author, Year).'"

STEP 1: Find that EXACT sentence in your text
STEP 2: Add ONE topic sentence (12-20 words) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT
STEP 3: Leave everything else unchanged

CRITICAL RULES:
- Find the EXACT sentence mentioned in the error
- Add EXACTLY ONE sentence (before or after)
- DO NOT rewrite the sentence that has the citation
- DO NOT move the citation
- DO NOT change any other sentences
</how_to_fix_citation_placement_errors>

<minimal_change>
CRITICAL: Make the SMALLEST possible changes to fix issues.

❌ WRONG - adding sentence at end of paragraph instead of after the citation:
ERROR: "Last sentence ends with citation: 'Research shows improvements (Smith, 2020).'"
WRONG FIX: Add sentence at very end of paragraph (not right after the citation)

✅ CORRECT - add sentence immediately after the problematic sentence:
ERROR: "Last sentence ends with citation: 'Research shows improvements (Smith, 2020).'"
CORRECT FIX: "Research shows improvements (Smith, 2020). These findings matter."
                                                         ^^^ Added RIGHT AFTER the citation
</minimal_change>

<preserve_argument>
Keep the same argument structure, thesis, and key points. Only fix technical errors.
</preserve_argument>

<word_count_discipline>
If text is over the limit:
- Fix issues by MODIFYING existing sentences, not adding new ones
- Combine sentences where possible
- Cut unnecessary words while fixing issues
