<citation_placement_rules>
<critical_rule_1>
NEVER place citations in the FIRST sentence of a body paragraph.
<reasoning>The first sentence (topic sentence) introduces the paragraph's main idea in the writer's own words.</reasoning>
</critical_rule_1>

<critical_rule_2>
NEVER place citations in the LAST sentence of a body paragraph.
<reasoning>The last sentence (concluding sentence) synthesizes the paragraph in the writer's own words.</reasoning>
</critical_rule_2>

<critical_rule_3>
Place citations ONLY in the MIDDLE sentences of paragraphs (sentences 2, 3, 4, etc.)
<reasoning>Middle sentences present evidence and support, which require citations to scholarly sources.</reasoning>
</critical_rule_3>

<correct_paragraph_structure>
Example of proper citation placement:

"Topic sentence introduces the main idea without citation. Second sentence develops the concept with supporting evidence (Smith, 2022). Third sentence continues the analysis and adds more research findings (Johnson, 2021). Concluding sentence synthesizes these ideas without citation."

<what_you_did>
- Sentence 1: No citation (topic sentence)
- Sentence 2: Added (Smith, 2022) in middle sentence
- Sentence 3: Added (Johnson, 2021) in middle sentence
- Sentence 4: No citation (concluding sentence)
</what_you_did>
</correct_paragraph_structure>

<incorrect_examples>
❌ WRONG: "(Smith, 2022) shows that healthcare costs are rising. Analysis continues."
<reason>Citation in first sentence violates topic sentence rule</reason>

❌ WRONG: "Healthcare costs are rising. Analysis shows this trend (Smith, 2022)."
<reason>Citation in last sentence violates concluding sentence rule</reason>
</incorrect_examples>
</citation_placement_rules>

3. Citations go BEFORE the period: "...this is true (Smith, 2023)."
4. Each source should be cited at least once
5. DO NOT add a References section
6. Keep ALL original text - only ADD citations
</formatting_rules>
