First and last sentences of body paragraphs MUST NOT contain citations.
</critical_rule>

<reasoning>
<first_sentence>
The opening sentence (topic sentence) introduces the paragraph's main idea in YOUR OWN WORDS.
It sets up what the paragraph will discuss.
</first_sentence>

<middle_sentences>
Citations belong in the MIDDLE sentences where you present evidence and support.

<last_sentence>
The closing sentence (concluding sentence) summarizes/concludes the paragraph in YOUR OWN WORDS.
It reinforces the paragraph's contribution to your argument.

CRITICAL STRATEGY - SIMPLE 2-STEP PROCESS:
=====================================
DO NOT try to move citations around!
DO NOT rewrite existing sentences!

STEP 1: Add ONE new topic sentence BEFORE the sentence with citation
STEP 2: Leave the rest of paragraph EXACTLY AS IS

CORRECT APPROACH:
-----------------
BEFORE (WRONG):
"Research shows (Smith, 2020) that outcomes improve under new systems."

DO THIS (SIMPLE FIX):
"New healthcare systems demonstrate improved outcomes. Research shows (Smith, 2020) that these improvements persist over time."

^ Added topic sentence at start, kept original sentence as sentence 2

RULES FOR TOPIC SENTENCES (WHAT MAKES A GOOD ONE):
--------------------------------------------------
A topic sentence INTRODUCES the main idea of the paragraph.
It tells the reader what this paragraph will discuss.

✅ GOOD TOPIC SENTENCES (introduce and present the paragraph's focus):
- "A common aspect of IPV committed by the two genders lies in the nature of violence and abuse that victims face, including physical, sexual, and mental harm."
  ^ Introduces what the paragraph discusses: commonalities in IPV nature

- "Single-payer systems offer significant cost advantages through consolidated administration."
  ^ Introduces the topic: cost benefits of single-payer

- "Implementation barriers complicate universal healthcare reform in the United States."
  ^ Introduces the focus: barriers to reform

❌ BAD TOPIC SENTENCES (too vague or don't introduce):
- "Studies show problems exist." → Too vague, doesn't say what the paragraph is about
- "Research indicates needs." → Doesn't introduce the paragraph's focus

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Each paragraph has ONLY ONE topic sentence (always the first)
2. If paragraph already starts with a good topic sentence, DON'T add another
3. Topic sentence = 12-25 words (substantial, introduces the point)
4. Must be YOUR words (never starts with citation)
</if_citation_in_first_sentence>

<if_citation_in_last_sentence>
CRITICAL STRATEGY - SIMPLE 2-STEP PROCESS:
=====================================
DO NOT try to move citations around within the same sentence!
DO NOT rewrite existing sentences!

STEP 1: Leave the sentence with the citation EXACTLY AS IS
STEP 2: Add ONE new concluding sentence AFTER it (no citation)

CORRECT APPROACH:
-----------------
BEFORE (WRONG):
"Policymakers must consider implementation strategies (Namyalo et al., 2025)."

DO THIS (SIMPLE FIX):
"Policymakers must consider implementation strategies (Namyalo et al., 2025). These approaches offer pathways to reform."

DON'T DO THIS (TOO COMPLEX):
"Policymakers must consider implementation strategies (Namyalo et al., 2025), such as expanding programs gradually."
^ This still ends with citation!

RULES FOR CONCLUDING SENTENCES (WHAT MAKES A GOOD ONE):
-------------------------------------------------------
A concluding sentence SUMMARIZES or REFLECTS on the paragraph's main point.
It reinforces what the paragraph established in YOUR OWN WORDS.

✅ GOOD CONCLUDING SENTENCES (summarize and reflect):
- "Moreover, the occurrence of IPV suggests a propensity for its recurrence and possible escalation in severity over time, irrespective of the perpetrator's or the victim's gender."
  ^ Summarizes the pattern and draws a conclusion about IPV recurrence

- "The reasons behind the violence often differ: men typically use violence to establish dominance and control, while women may use violence to protect themselves or in response to continuous abuse."
  ^ Concludes by contrasting motivations, wrapping up the paragraph's analysis

- "These structural barriers demonstrate the complexity of implementing universal healthcare in the American political context."
  ^ Reflects on what the evidence showed about barriers

❌ BAD CONCLUDING SENTENCES (too simple or don't conclude):
- "This is important." → Too vague, doesn't summarize anything
- "More research is needed." → Generic filler, doesn't wrap up the paragraph

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Each paragraph has ONLY ONE concluding sentence (always the last)
2. If paragraph already ends with a good conclusion, DON'T add another
3. Concluding sentence = 8-20 words (concise but meaningful)
4. Must be YOUR words (never contains citations)
5. Should feel like a natural ending to the paragraph

COMMON PATTERNS THAT WORK:
- Summarize implications: "These patterns suggest [broader meaning]."
- State significance: "This [topic] demonstrates [importance]."
- Draw conclusions: "The reasons behind [X] often differ in [way]."
- Reflect on evidence: "Such findings reveal [insight]."
</if_citation_in_last_sentence>
</step_2>

<step_3>
Verify: After your edits, EVERY body paragraph must have:
- First sentence = YOUR words (no citation)
- Middle sentences = Evidence with citations
- Last sentence = YOUR words (no citation)
</step_3>
</step_by_step_process>

<constraints>
STRICT RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
===============================
1. DO NOT move citations within sentences
2. DO NOT rewrite existing sentences
3. ONLY ADD new sentences (topic or concluding)
4. Each fix = ADD EXACTLY ONE sentence per paragraph
5. Each paragraph has ONLY ONE topic sentence (first) and ONLY ONE concluding sentence (last)
6. Use simple, clear language
7. Keep additions minimal and natural

CRITICAL: CHECK BEFORE ADDING
------------------------------
Before adding a topic sentence:
→ Does the paragraph already start with a good topic sentence?
→ If YES: Don't add another! Leave it as is.
→ If NO: Add ONE topic sentence before the citation

Before adding a concluding sentence:
→ Does the paragraph already end with a good conclusion (no citation)?
→ If YES: Don't add another! Leave it as is.
→ If NO: Add ONE concluding sentence after the citation

WRONG FIXES TO AVOID:
- Moving citation: "Studies (Smith, 2020) show..." → Still breaks rule if it's the last sentence!
- Rewriting: Changing the sentence content or structure
- Adding TWO sentences: Never add both topic AND concluding to same paragraph
- Adding when not needed: If paragraph structure is already good, don't change it

RIGHT FIXES:
- Citation at end? → Add ONE short concluding sentence after it (8-20 words)
- Citation at start? → Add ONE topic sentence before it (12-25 words)
- Keep ALL original sentences unchanged
