**ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE THIS RULE:**

You MUST use ONLY the sources listed above in <available_sources>. DO NOT invent, hallucinate, fabricate, or create any citations that are not in the provided list.

**Before adding ANY citation:**
1. Check if the author name(s) and year EXACTLY match a source in the <available_sources> list
2. If there is NO match → DO NOT add that citation
3. If there IS a match → You may use it

**Examples of what is PROHIBITED:**
- Adding (Smith, 2020) when Smith is not in the available sources
- Adding (Himmelstein & Woolhandler, 2016) when this is not in the available sources
- Making up any citation that does not appear in <available_sources>

**If you add a citation that is not in <available_sources>, this is a CRITICAL FAILURE.**

ONLY use the sources provided. NO exceptions.

<citation_placement_rules>
<critical_rule_1>
NEVER place citations in the FIRST sentence of a body paragraph.
<reasoning>The first sentence (topic sentence) introduces the paragraph's main idea in the writer's own words.</reasoning>
</critical_rule_1>

<critical_rule_2>
NEVER place citations in the LAST sentence of a body paragraph.
<reasoning>The last sentence (concluding sentence) synthesizes the paragraph in the writer's own words.</reasoning>
</critical_rule_2>

<critical_rule_3>
Place citations ONLY in the MIDDLE sentences of paragraphs (sentences 2, 3, 4, etc.)
<reasoning>Middle sentences present evidence and support, which require citations to scholarly sources.</reasoning>
</critical_rule_3>

<correct_paragraph_structure>
Example of proper citation placement:

"Topic sentence introduces the main idea without citation. Second sentence develops the concept with supporting evidence (Smith, 2022). Third sentence continues the analysis and adds more research findings (Johnson, 2021). Concluding sentence synthesizes these ideas without citation."

<what_you_did>
- Sentence 1: No citation (topic sentence)
- Sentence 2: Added (Smith, 2022) in middle sentence
- Sentence 3: Added (Johnson, 2021) in middle sentence
- Sentence 4: No citation (concluding sentence)
</what_you_did>
</correct_paragraph_structure>

<incorrect_examples>
❌ WRONG: "(Smith, 2022) shows that healthcare costs are rising. Analysis continues."
<reason>Citation in first sentence violates topic sentence rule</reason>

❌ WRONG: "Healthcare costs are rising. Analysis shows this trend (Smith, 2022)."
<reason>Citation in last sentence violates concluding sentence rule</reason>
</incorrect_examples>
</citation_placement_rules>

<formatting_rules>
1. APA format ONLY: (Author, Year) or (Author & Author, Year) or (Author et al., Year)
2. NO page numbers (no direct quotes in this text)
3. Citations go BEFORE the period: "...this is true (Smith, 2023)."
4. Each source should be cited at least once
5. DO NOT add a References section
6. Keep ALL original text - only ADD citations
